Chatbot Arena is an open-source research project developed by members from LMSYS and UC Berkeley SkyLab. Our mission is to build an open platform to evaluate LLMs by human preference in the real-world. We open-source our FastChat project at GitHub and release chat and human feedback dataset. We invite everyone to join us!
